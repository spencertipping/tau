# τ: programming in 𝓛 space
τ is a runtime system built around temporary steady states. If a bash command like `cat ... | grep ... | gzip > ...` defines a pipeline in a time-invariant way, then τ extends this by adding the ability to modify and extend the pipeline at runtime; that is, each part of the program is time-invariant but there are step changes. ([`ni`](https://github.com/spencertipping/ni) captures some of this, but ultimately falls short.)

Another way to think of it is that τ is to bash what the Laplace transform is to the Fourier transform: we can now describe systems that are locally time-invariant but which nonetheless change over time.
