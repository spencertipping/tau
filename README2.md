# œÑ: programming in ùìõ space
œÑ is a runtime system built around temporary steady states. If a bash command like `cat ... | grep ... | gzip > ...` defines a pipeline in a time-invariant way, then œÑ extends this by adding the ability to modify and extend the pipeline at runtime; that is, each part of the program is time-invariant but there are step changes. ([`ni`](https://github.com/spencertipping/ni) captures some of this, but ultimately falls short.)

Another way to think of it is that œÑ is to `ni` what the Laplace transform is to the Fourier transform: we can now describe systems that are locally time-invariant but which nonetheless change over time.


## Œ¶ runtime system
A garbage-collected dataflow graph whose components ([Œ≥](doc2/gamma.md)) are cooperatively multithreaded ([Œª](doc2/lambda.md) and [Œõ](doc2/Lambda.md)) and communicate with FIFO queues ([Œ∂](doc2/zeta.md), a vector of which is called [œÜ](doc2/phi.md)). All side-effects are contained as messages on these FIFOs, sent to a process boundary called [Œ¶](doc2/Phi.md).

We can define a GC for Œ≥s using the œÜ graph: a Œ≥ is live only when there's a Œ∂-path to Œ¶.


## œÄ scripting
[œÄ](doc2/pi.md) is a small concatenative bytecode language used to implement individual Œªs. It also hosts the [Œì](doc2/Gamma.md) matrix compiler API, which is used to create Œ¶ dataflow components.

œÄ manipulates [Œ∑](doc2/eta.md) values; [Œ∑‚ÇÄ](doc2/eta0.md) is the container format, inside which types such as Œ∑‚ÇÅ, Œ∑‚ÇÇ, etc are allocated. Œ∑ is platform-independent with a few exceptions; platform-locked values are tagged so that they cannot be sent elsewhere without first being converted.
