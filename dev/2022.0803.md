## The metaphor problem
I've come up with a number of metaphors for how operators/ports/fabric etc are represented:

+ orbit/chan/axis
+ cell/port/leaf
+ λ/ψ/Λ

I kinda like Greek letters because they're robust identifiers and also _don't_ form a metaphor. The only downside is that we're keeping them from user code, although I doubt it's an issue because none of these letters would be common in τ programs.
