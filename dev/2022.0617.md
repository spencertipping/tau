## Lazy computation
+ useful for stream fusion
+ can/should we encode `map`, `filter`, etc as genuine stream ops that require a destination before emitting data?
  + can/should we have these use a mini-fabric?
    + since records are arbitrarily embeddable, we can stream results into them (via mutable buffers, no big issue there)
    + mini-fabric means map/filter/etc can be parallelized (!)


## GC
+ since values are immutable, let's collect _regions_
  + GC marking is done in terms of byte ranges
  + detect pipeline linearity and alias our values
