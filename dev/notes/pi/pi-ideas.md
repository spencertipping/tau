# π ideas
+ Leverage vectorization eagerly: "string → float" should produce float vectors if the string contains delimiters
+ Operators defined in terms of streams, e.g. anything that returns a tuple can stream out without collecting
+ APL-style semantics in general, where applicable
+ vi-style modality
+ Automated ergonomic profiling (doesn't have to be complicated)


## τ stream interop
+ Very easy quoting
+ Streams must be easy to refer to and connect to
+ π operates _inside_ γ, so we can use procedural access to φs
