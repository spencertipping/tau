# π runtime
π is an imperative language that powers a single λ, with syscall-style functions that operate various aspects of a γ -- most notably, moving UTF9 across φs. At present there's no reason for multiple π λs to interoperate; once we're doing that, we probably want to write the γ in C++. (There is also nothing preventing π from working this way.)
