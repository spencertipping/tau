# π editor (in π)
If we were writing a regular text editor, we'd use a stream of text lines, each of which is modifiable. Assuming a monospace font, we'd calculate the text dimensions and manually position each line with respect to the prior.

π is different because it isn't fundamentally text-based. Each character has spatial continuations in several directions.
