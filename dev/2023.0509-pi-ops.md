# π operators and syntax
I need to figure out how σ/π operator bindings should work. So far I've decided on right-associative 1/2/3-ary operators with a flat parse-dispatch model. Ops and atoms have disjoint parse prefixes; that is, our parse is effectively untyped tokens that are then associated by arity.

Anyway, I need to get a feel for how this is going to work so let's try some stuff:

```conf
"foo" + "bar"   # string concatenation
1 @(2 3 4) 5    # sequence flattening
```

**Decision:** whitespace or punct for plurals/ternary? Let's say either: `,` forces a break. This way we keep `abc` brevity for nullary `abc`, but we get around the `foo[3]` problem:

```conf
("foo",[1])  # multiple elements
(1 2 3)      # multiple elements
("foo"[1])   # single element

"foo"[1 2]   # hard breaking case if we don't have , to fall back on
```

**TODO:** we need `φauto` for bracket-`πfs` continuations so we can parse `1 2 3]` and `1 2 3}`
