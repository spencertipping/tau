# Loop
UTF9 data is manipulated by an axial machine defined by a network of loops, and for homoiconicity's sake loops are themselves defined in terms of the UTF9 schema. A loop can describe multiple axial planes as well as the linkages between them.

As implied by the name, loops are circuits; because a program's space of side effects forms a boundary, any steady state of the program must be a cycle involving that boundary (for sufficiently generous definitions of side effects and boundary).
