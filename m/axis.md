# Axis
Mechanical intuition applies: objects along the same axis have comparable _θ_ angles and cycles, multiple axes require couplings that may introduce slop/lag (network RPC). In concrete terms, an axis is a process that hosts an event loop and multiple components, all of which can be synchronized into a single, consistent angular timeline.

τ programs are defined in terms of coaxial structure.
