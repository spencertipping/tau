# Operators
Operators are micro-processes: they read and write data using streams, optionally transforming them or maintaining state in the process. Operators also handle events on their streams, of which there are several:

+ _α_, start-of-data
+ _ι_, stream-is-ready
+ _ρ_, remanent cycle circumference
+ _θ_, approximate cycle angle
+ _τ_, end-of-cycle
+ _κ_, stream-not-ready
+ _ω_, end-of-data

**TODO:** how do operators define data streams?
