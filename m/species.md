# Species
_Species_ describes the variant of thing, whether that thing is a cell, leaf, or trunk. A species contains enough information to identify exactly what type something is, which means a mixture of functionality, version, and platform. `sha256((c++ source, uname -a))` would be a valid way to construct the species for an object.
