# ∏ modeling
Human experience and imitation provide a substantial advantage over machines when writing code. Our code isn't good in any principled sense, but it is effective and well-tuned to its domain. Too much so in some cases, hence technical debt. In other words, humans are much better domain experts than we are computational thinkers, at least most of the time.

All of this matters because code has little hope of encoding human domains with any fidelity given its purpose. Intents, arbitrarily divorced from time-domain coding, can capture a much more relevant latent space; but nobody has encoded it for us yet. If we want ∏ to ship with such a latent space up front, we have to create it.
