# γ₀
τ boots up into a single [Φ](Phi.md), abstracted as a [Γ](Gamma.md). This Γ constructs the "boot native", which we call γ₀. (This is not a hard requirement, it just happens if no [Ξ](Xi.md) overrides the default Γ behavior.)

γ₀ is responsible for defining the set of boundary operations available to all γs within a Φ. For example, γ₀ can service "create γs" and "create a Φ" requests. You can think of γ₀ as τ's standard library.
