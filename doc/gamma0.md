# γ₀
γ₀ is the "root γ" within each [Φ](Phi.md); it's responsible for allocating and connecting other γs in response to [Ξ](Xi.md)/[ξ](xi.md) requests. It also holds the Φ's private key and is the sole demultiplexer for incoming trunk messages (although the messages themselves can come from other γs). Here's a full list of γ₀'s responsibilities:

1. Generate Φ's initial private key
2. Accept UTF9-encoded requests to create and connect new γs (Ξ/ξ)
3. Negotiate symmetric keys with any other Φ
4. Multiplex + encrypt outbound traffic for a Φ
5. Decrypt + verify + demultiplex inbound traffic from a Φ
6. Maintain the trunk gateway routing table
7. Destroy the Φ


## Bootup
γ₀ owns `argv` on native Φ builds and can read UTF9 topologies from files, stdin, or command-line arguments. The initial topology is instantiated as if by γ request.

Connections to γ₀, which amount to `eval`, are specified by the initial ξ as part of the program. That is, the resulting γs will connect to γ₀'s fabric server to be able to issue modifications. γs that don't have this connection won't be able to modify the topology, beyond deconstructing themselves.
