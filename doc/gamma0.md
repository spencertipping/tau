# γ₀
γ₀ is the "root γ" within each [Φ](Phi.md); it's responsible for allocating and connecting other γs in response to [Ξ](Xi.md)/[ξ](xi.md) requests. It also holds the Φ's private key and is the sole demultiplexer for incoming trunk messages (although the messages themselves can come from other γs). Here's a full list of γ₀'s responsibilities:

1. Generate Φ's initial private key
2. Accept UTF9-encoded requests to create and connect new γs (Ξ/ξ)
3. Negotiate symmetric keys with any other Φ
4. Multiplex + encrypt outbound traffic for a Φ
5. Decrypt + verify + demultiplex inbound traffic from a Φ
6. Maintain the trunk gateway routing table
7. Destroy the Φ
