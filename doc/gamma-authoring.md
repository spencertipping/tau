# γ authoring
How C++-hosted natives are written.


## γ₀
First, each τ program has a bootup γ, γ₀, that accepts further UTF9-encoded instructions to create γs and connect them. Each connection request consists of two pieces:

1. A map of `γid → (name config-map)` defining the γs we intend to create
2. A list of `(γid1, φ1, γid2, φ2)` tuples defining the space of ζs

Addresses are unique to a specific connection request. The γ₀ will reply with another mapping of `γid → (Γid = (Φid, Φγid))` that anchors each request-local γ ID to a permanent and globally unique one.


## Declarative elements
The γ initialization section of [Γ](Gamma.md) specifies a "pre-init" function that takes [Ξ](Xi.md) and creates any [φ](phi.md)s that might be mentioned within the [ξ](xi.md) connection list.

Because Ξ is fixed at construction-time, we should assume that any template-style unknowns have been resolved before γ₀ receives it. That is, γ doesn't participate in Ξ modification nor invariant propagation.


## γ lifecycle
1. `γ₀` selects the γ constructor
