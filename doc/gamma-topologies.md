# γ topologies
τ is much more open-ended than `bash` or `ni` because components are meant to be arbitrarily stateful, and Φ/Γ allow dynamic re-routing.

Although γs can have any topologies at all, many systems will conform to a handful of common patterns.


## Server connections
To get a quick constraint out of the way.

Most φs are FIFOs, like bash pipes, but any φ can be marked as a "server", which means that connection requests to that φ will be redirected to a different one, whose ID will be provided on the ζ connected to the server φ. It's roughly the same type of `listen`/`accept` machinery provided by Berkeley sockets, but `accept` happens automatically and no endpoint information is provided.

λs reading server φ events are not guaranteed to be scheduled in any particular order, so it isn't possible to have a server act as a reliable semaphore/mutex. (You could _ω_ all but one of the accepted connections after the fact, however.)


## ϝι
`bash` uses a unidirectional `f | g | h` compositional pipeline, where `stderr` is untagged-unioned across each command. If we treat `stderr` as read/write (which it is), then we get this:

```
term ------+----------+----------+
           V          V          V
        +-----+    +-----+    +-----+
term -> |  f  | -> |  g  | -> |  h  | -> term
        +-----+    +-----+    +-----+
           |          |          |
           +----------+----------+-----> term
```

Let's use the diagram above to define the basic "operator shape", translating FDs into φ indexes:

```
                 control (δ)
                   ^ |
                   | |
                   | V
              +----------+
input (α) --> | operator | --> output (β)
              +----------+
                   ^ |
                   | |
                   | V
            diagnostics/debug (ε)
```

α and β are technically bidirectional but practically one-way; data normally moves from left to right. Operators are not required to do anything with reverse data, nor even to have ζs allocated for it.

δ and ε need not be defined for every component.


## ϝϊ
Just like above, but α and β can move data in both directions. These are commonly used adjacent to boundaries or multiplexers; for example, encryption/decryption with key negotiation, adaptive compression/decompression, or time synchronization.


## ϝΦ
```
      +-----+
α <-> | phi |
      +-----+
```

These may define δ and/or ε, but usually don't. Files and sockets are some examples of boundary components. It's common to use them with [ϝτ](#ϝτ) when defining pipelines.


## ϝΘ
Just like ϝΦ, but uses β.

```
+-------+
| theta | <-> β
+-------+
```


## ϝα
A special case of ϝΦ that is input-only.


## ϝβ
```
        new (β)
         |
         V
      +-----+
      |     | <-> β₁
α <-> | mux | <-> β₂
      |     | <-> β₃
      +-----+ ...
         |
         V
        oob (ε)
```

Here α is used as the compound channel, β as the demultiplexed side, and ε for out-of-band values arriving on α. α and β are both bidirectional, and β is a server φ.


## ϝτ
A way to mix unidirectional and bidirectional operators. For example, if we wanted to multiplex a pipeline in both directions, we'd need a loop to connect the pipeline's α and β to the same bidirectional φ for the multiplexer.

```
      +------+
      |      | --> ε
α <-> | loop |
      |      | <-- δ
      +------+
```

You'd use it like this:

```
     +-----+       +------+
     |     |       |      |ε --> op1 --> op2 --> op3 --+
<-> α| mux |β <-> α| loop |                            |
     |     |       |      |δ <-------------------------+
     +-----+       +------+
```


## ϝγ
These broadcast every message to every connection.

```
   new (β)
    |
    V
+------+
|      | <-> β₁
| room | <-> β₂
|      | <-> β₃
+------+ ...
    |
    V
  state (ε)
```

ε is a stream of join/leave notifications.


## ϝδ
For example, registers, rate-limiters, and other things that are value-agnostic but modify the flow of a ζ.

```
       ctrl (δ)
         |
         V
      +-----+
α --> | mod | <-> β
      +-----+
         |
         V
       state (ε)
```

β is bidirectional so it can respond to ι and κ requests.
