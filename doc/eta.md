# η values
η is one type of value that you can send through a [ξ](xi.md). η values provide consistent endianness, struct layout, type tagging, and namespaces for signals and other out-of-band data.

**η is designed for simplicity above almost all else.** As the interop format, I'm going to end up writing multiple η libraries -- C++, Rust, Python, and maybe Go.

## Format
Each η value's size can be calculated in constant time, with the exception of the toplevel value which is a stream of values. Each value begins with a control byte, which describes the type and size-encoding of the thing that comes after it. There are 16 types and 16 size encodings:

| High 4 bits | Type                                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `0x0_`      | stream signal                               |
| `0x1_`      | big-endian int (must be 1, 2, 4, or 8-byte) |
| `0x2_`      | big-endian float (must be 4-byte or 8-byte) |
| `0x3_`      | string                                      |
| `0x4_`      | atom (`true`/`false`/`null`)                |
| `0x5_`      | sub-η stream (used for nesting)             |
| `0x6_`      | name prefix                                 |
| `0x7_`      | **reserved**                                |
| `0x8_`      | `int8s`                                     |
| `0x9_`      | `int16s` (big-endian)                       |
| `0xa_`      | `int32s` (big-endian)                       |
| `0xb_`      | `int64s` (big-endian)                       |
| `0xc_`      | `float32s` (big-endian)                     |
| `0xd_`      | `float64s` (big-endian)                     |
| `0xe_`      | **reserved**                                |
| `0xf_`      | **reserved**                                |

| Low 4 bits | Next bytes     | Size encoding |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| `0x_0`     |                | 0 byte        |
| `0x_1`     |                | 1 bytes       |
| `0x_2`     |                | 2 bytes       |
| `0x_3`     |                | 3 bytes       |
| `0x_4`     |                | 4 bytes       |
| `0x_5`     |                | 5 bytes       |
| `0x_6`     |                | 6 bytes       |
| `0x_7`     |                | 7 bytes       |
| `0x_8`     |                | 8 bytes       |
| `0x_9`     |                | 9 bytes       |
| `0x_a`     |                | 10 bytes      |
| `0x_b`     |                | 11 bytes      |
| `0x_c`     |                | 12 bytes      |
| `0x_d`     | 1              | 13 + `x`      |
| `0x_e`     | 2 (big-endian) | 269 + `x`     |
| `0x_f`     | 4 (big-endian) | 65805 + `x`   |

Tuples and maps are both encoded into the stream by having multiple values. For example, the hex bytes `1101 1102 1103` encode the array `[1, 2, 3]`. The vectorized version would be `83 010203`.

`0x6_` is used to assign names to some stream values, which is done in the context of a map. For example, `63 f o o 11 02 63 b a r 11 05` corresponds to `{"foo":2, "bar":5}`.

There is no requirement that an η stream contain only name-prefixed things or only un-prefixed things, although these are common configurations. There is also no requirement about the relative layout of named/unnamed things. This is a feature: since values closer to the front of the stream are faster to decode, strategic ordering can improve performance.
