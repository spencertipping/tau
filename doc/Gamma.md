# Γ
It's possible to write operators just in terms of φ, λ, and ζ, but γ is preferable because it reorients those abstractions to focus on a single task. Similarly, it's possible to code distributed systems directly against Φ, but Γ ties it together by adding routing and RPCs. Γ is like a Φ that is aware of γ.


## Φ₀
τ boots into Φ₀, the initial Linux process that runs a τ program. At this point Γ = {Φ₀}. Φ₀'s γ₀ includes operations that create other Φs within other runtimes, including the browser (via a precompiled image from emscripten). When you create a new runtime, let's say Φ₁, then Γ = {Φ₀, Φ₁}.

There is currently no plan for Γ to manage Φ₀ migration for failover, although I don't imagine it would be difficult to implement.


## Multi-Φ Γ abstraction
The primary goal here is to unify all {γ : Φ} into a single addressible space with appropriate allowances for temporary connection drops and unsecured linkages. The end result is that you don't need to think about Φ boundaries at all; γs can communicate freely across an apparently uniform address space.

This involves four parts in practice:

1. Γ-unique Φ identification (note that Φ IDs must be secure)
2. L2-switched traffic across connected Φ, with customizable route blocking
3. Latency-controlled boundary multiplexing
4. Reconnection handling with session persistence


##  γ initialization
Handled by [γ₀](gamma0.md), the initial native within each Φ.

1. [Ξ](Xi.md) is consulted to determine what type of [γ](gamma.md) to create, and the [Φ](Phi.md) where it should be located
2. Γ routes the request to the target Φ, whose γ₀ receives the creation request
3. The new γ object runs its "pre-init" against Ξ, initializing all φ
4. Once all new γ have been initialized this way, connections are read from [ξ](xi.md) and ζs created to connect φs

Step (4) happens atomically from the perspective of all γs within the same Φ.
