# Γ
It's possible to write operators just in terms of φ, λ, and ζ, but γ is preferable because it reorients those abstractions to focus on a single task. Similarly, it's possible to code distributed systems directly against Φ, but Γ ties it together by adding routing and RPCs. Γ is like a Φ that is aware of γ.
