# π types
π has a type system, but it's not principally about types. Instead, the intent is to capture and propagate all of the compile-time entropy available. Sometimes this involves choosing a polymorphic variant (e.g. `+` over vectors/tuples/strings), other times it can be in response to a constraint-as-test-case that reduces the space of acceptable implementations (e.g. to force a certain level of floating-point precision).
