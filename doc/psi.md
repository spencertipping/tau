# ψ
A pipe (ψ) carries data bidirectionally, each side a serial queue (ζ) with a bounded capacity for in-flight messages. ζs are reliable and fully ordered per direction. **Pipes are never cut-through,** and can never guarantee that a message was successfully processed, absent explicit handshaking to that effect.

Back-traffic is often used to send control messages; e.g. κ = "writes are blocked", ι = "writes are unblocked", ω = "end of transmission".


## Control message priority
**[Non]-problem:** we want back-flow κ and ι messages to skip over buffered messages, potentially.

**Resolution:** nothing about ζ specifies that this couldn't happen: κ and ι are generated by Ψ asynchronously -- that is, without a specific λ/Φ source. They'll be buffered only when embedded within a multiplexed channel, but that's arguably the right strategy anyway as it doesn't require us to do anything special when assigning priorities to messages from multiple source streams (e.g. to guarantee fairness).


## Ψ/Φ
Φ boundaries interact with Ψ by receiving the read-end of one ζ and the write-end of the other ζ for a given ψ. (The other sides connect to a single different Φ.)
