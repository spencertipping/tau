# ρ
A semi-structured editor with 2.5D nonlinearity. ρ modifies UTF9 data, providing a UTF9 edit trail as you do so. This edit trail is constructed in such a way that intent can be inferred reliably, which means you can reassemble different documents easily by modifying user-edit timelines even if they were made out of sync.
