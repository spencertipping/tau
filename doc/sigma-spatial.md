# Spatial computation
**Q:** what is the total effect space? e.g for τ in general it's very bounded: ψ can only emit on ξ. We need to define something similar here.

**Q:** how do we accommodate "populate a database" as an intended effect?

**Idea:** _G → k τ[...]_: keyed _τ_ groups to explore, then _k ... → A → v_ to calculate final values

**TODO:** what does it mean to linearize a spatial domain, especially given that we apparently also want to deduplicate it?
