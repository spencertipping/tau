# π scripting
π is a series of [φ](phi.md) parsers that allow [Γs](Gamma.md) and [η](eta.md)-transforming functions to be defined from string inputs, ultimately making it possible to write τ programs without compiling code.


## π values
π can manipulate pretty much any value. This means not only things we store in η, but also Γ, ξ, Ξ, and other natives. Note that natives cannot be written into ξs. Not all natives have comprehensive support, but nothing stops π from working with them.

Critically, this means that **all π operands must have a consistent memory-addressing scheme** -- in this case, `Sp<T>` for various `T`.
