# π scripting
C++ gives us the flexibility to define a reasonable DSL for [γ](gamma.md), so we can write `a | b | c` to get a composite pipeline. That's a good start. Unfortunately, C++ also has some limitations:

1. It has non-instant compile times
2. Some γs require functions, which are a little verbose
3. We end up copy/pasting the admittedly small scaffold code between hard-coded examples, and writing `if()` dispatch logic to select them

π is a series of [φ](phi.md) parsers that allow γs and [η](eta.md)-transforming functions to be defined from string inputs, ultimately making it possible to write τ programs without compiling code.
