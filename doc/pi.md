# π
An interpreted, imperative bytecode language used to implement [γ](gamma.md)s. Augmented by the [∏](Pi.md) frontend for higher-level compilation.

As a concept, π covers everything from the runtime and GC up to the bytecode assembler and basic control flow. ∏ picks up from there to define the intent system and macros that compile down to this bytecode.
