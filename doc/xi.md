# ξ
A sparse list of [Γ](Gamma.md)-level φ/φ connection requests that is consulted as the final stage of γ initialization. At its core, ξ is a list of `(γ₁, φ₁, γ₂, φ₂)` tuples, where each γ is a Γ-level γ identifier -- that is, a global address. φs are integers used to select a φ from each γ.


## ξ and cross-Φ ζs
[γ₀](gamma0.md) receives Γ-level connection requests, which require translation and possibly multiplexing as they encounter Φ boundaries.


## Server connections
[φ](phi.md)s are strictly for established [ζ](zeta.md) communication; unlike UNIX, γs don't create φs to listen for connections and redirect to other ports.
