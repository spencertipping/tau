# ξ
A sparse list of [Γ](Gamma.md)-level φ/φ connection requests that is consulted as the final stage of γ initialization. At its core, ξ is a list of `(γ₁, φ₁, γ₂, φ₂)` tuples, where each γ is a Γ-level γ identifier -- that is, a global address. φs are integers used to select a φ from each γ.

ξ is also used to describe a component you can create, which has a ϝ topology.
