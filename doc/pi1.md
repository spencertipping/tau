# π₁
An intent-aware compiler that produces [π₀](pi0.md) bytecode. π₁ is multilevel in that it can consume direct bytecodes, APL-style imperative code, or high-level intent-driven implicit code (or a mixture of these).

π₁ views "code" as a search query over the space of programs, and that search query can have a varying amount of specificity.

π₁ interacts in realtime with [π₂](pi2.md), the source editor.
