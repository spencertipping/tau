# γ
A [π₀](pi0.md)-hosted abstraction that contains λs and [φs](phi.md). The idea is to jointly define (1) polymorphic λ/φ containers, and (2) polysemantic connection operators.

τ Laplacian eigenvectors are just π₀ functions that achieve these φ connections, so γ operators are eigenvector constituents.


## Examples
+ Asqi
  + Inbound SSH connection ↔ git process
  + Inbound HTTP connection ↔ user session
  + User navigation → document OT connection
  + User search/nav action → search prediction
+ Map/reduce
  + Input file → mapper → sort → combiner → shuffle input
  + Shuffle output → reducer → output
+ `ni`/ETL
  + CLI → pipeline
  + Sharding → [pipeline]
  + Horizontal scaling → [pipeline]
