# γ
Higher-order abstraction over [φ](phi.md) and λ to create composable operators. The basic idea is to surface φs in such a way that they can be connected into standard topologies, and to bundle up λs such that we can destroy all related resources at the same time.

The boot γ within each [Φ](Phi.md), [γ₀](gamma0.md), accepts commands to construct γ components and tie them together.

+ [γ design](gamma-design.md)
+ [γ authoring](gamma-authoring.md)
+ [γ topologies](gamma-topologies.md)

[Γ](Gamma.md) unifies all Φs.
