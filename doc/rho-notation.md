# ρ notation
As one might expect by reading the τ source code, there's going to be a lot of Unicode in π programs, some math and some simplified Chinese. Math is used for code-oriented abstractions, Chinese for human-oriented ones -- for example, you might write _∑x → 人_ to indicate that you want to show a sum of _x_ to a user.

The overall goal of notation is to convey the structure of a program efficiently to the person who is reading it (_读者_ or _阅读人_, if you wanted to write it as an intent).
