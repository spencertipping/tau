# τ exponents
I've thought of τ as a unitless symbol representing a cycle, which doesn't have any analogue in higher dimensions. τ = τ² = τ³ = .... If we want higher-dimensional τ, we encase it within another data structure that contextualizes it; for example, `("foo", τ)` within a `t[0]` multiplexed stream.

But in the interest of flexibility, we might introduce explicit exponents that modify the cycle dimension. We'd need similar for θ and ι, most likely. This means every stream is implicitly dimension-vectorized, just like numbers are.

Stream dimensions operate toroidally.
