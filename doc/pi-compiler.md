# π compiler
Consumes keystrokes and produces output for the [π interpreter](pi-interpreter.md).

It's probably more accurate to think of the compiler as an IDE, but its core constraint is that it needs to resolve polymorphism before generating what are effectively bytecodes in its UTF9 sexp-style output.
