# Greeks
Uppercase for outer views of ideas, lowercase for inner views. For example, an operator is either γ (the inner API) or Γ (the outer API, which manages many of them).

In code, suffixes modify concepts: `λi` is an ID for a λ, for example.

**NOTE:** these are τ-internal abstractions; for UTF9 state symbols, see [utf9.md](utf9.md).

+ γ: an operator (Γ: the flux core)
+ Φ: user/kernel boundary
+ Ψ: cross-γ flux
+ ψ: within-γ port
+ ζ: unidirectional queue
+ λ: coro/fiber (Λ = coro scheduler)
+ Θ: time/deadline scheduler
