# φ: 〈ξ〉
Mathematically, φ is a vector of [ξs](xi.md) used as the input and output of [γ](gamma.md) matrices.

φ channels can point in either direction. This is important because some γs expect a pair of channels, one pointing each way, to perform some type of negotiation -- for example OT, throughput-dependent compression, or ED25519.
