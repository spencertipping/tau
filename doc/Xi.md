# Ξ
Declarative configuration for γs, like a starting point for the ξ control channel. Ξ is input to γ₀: it ultimately converts from user-provided τ source to the Ξ `i9` objects provided as initializers to the resulting γs.


## γ side
γ perceives Ξ to be an `i9` value that can be addressed to provide configuration options.

**TODO:** declare Ξ interfacing in a way that informs its τ-source DSL integration -- more general than parser combinators, but more specific than "here's an option with no further context"

**NOTE:** Ξ interfacing should be UTF9 so we can forward foreign natives across RPCs

**TODO:** Ξ should use an enum or other hard type, not strings, to select data entries


## τ side
Ξ is a parser that consumes a uniform, human-writable source encoding and translates it into the `i9` values used to initialize γs.
